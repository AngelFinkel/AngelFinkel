- âš¡ Fun fact: The world's quietest room is located at Microsoft's headquarters in Washington.
- It's an anechoic chamber designed to be so quiet you can hear your own heartbeat and even the blood flowing in your ears. The walls are covered in special wedge-shaped panels that absorb sound waves, and the room is even isolated from vibrations in the ground.
